# Supervised Learning after Feature Extraction
[Code (Jupyter Notebook)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fkarimzadeh6/CX4240_project/blob/Nael/clustering_top_v2.ipynb)
### Dataset
The original dataset consists of 16330 samples, 1633 each from 10 different subjects. Each sample is accompanied by a label (N1, N2, N3, N4 and REM) denoted by 0,1,2,3,4 respectively. The dataset is trimmed to eliminate the first 833 samples which consists entirely of a single label (0). This would have biased the dataset heavily towards a single label. The trimmed dataset now consists of 8330 samples each with 7 features. The following charts shows the distribution of various labels within the dataset. The dataset contains the most of the N2 stage as is expected in a standard sleeping pattern of a subject:

### Perceptron Algorithm 
The Perceptron learning algorithm is a linear classifer that assigns weights to features of a sample to generate a hyperplane. The plane  is then updated based on any wrong classifications. This continues until the weights converge to an optimum solution (the average loss changes by less than a tolerance between successive iterations). The perceptron algorithm is guaranteed to converge, provided the dataset is linearly separable.

An example of the change in the hyperplane as the weights are updated is demonstrated below:
