# Problem Definition and Motivation:
During  the  past  decades,  a  great  body  of research   has   been   devoted   to   automatic   sleep   stage scoring using the electroencephalogram (EEG).  Automatically and accurate classification of sleep stages from EEG signals are critical due to the fact that these information will be used for dioagnosing different sleep disorders. However, the results are not yet satisfactory to be used as a standard procedure  in  clinical  studies.  In  this  project, we have investigated different machine learning algorithms to automatically classify sleep stages and compared the results.
